                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>My Debtors was founded with the goal of acting as a bridge between various schools and their students that are owing, in order to achieve the purpose of saving schools from admitting student debtors and help students track how much they owe</p>
                <p>Due to a research carried out in december 2020, 75% of students left over 3500 schools bankrupt after being unable to track their payment status and some were unaware.</p>
                <p>We have also helped sschools regulate their cash flows and boosted the confidence of students by being aware of thier payment status</p>
                <p>At my Debtors, we believe that no school should be forced to shut down due to the debts of students.
                    Our strong desire to help both schools and students has helped us to solve over 1,670 cases so far which at the end left schools smiling and able to recover every penny of both new and old debts.
                </p>
                <p>We also left students thankful for being able to be aware of their debt and pay.</p>
                <p>We ensure that there is proper relationship between the schools and students from the begining of their agreement to the end.</p>

                    <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
                    <p>Our vision is to build a safe and welcoming platform for all our users (schools and parents), where nobody will be judged but fully accepted. We strive to create better and easier methods of accessing our platform and also ensure parties involved are satisfied throughtout the transaction process.
                        as we move towards our goal of being a world-class platform, we will ensure that nothing but excellence will be delivered. We strongly believe that by 2030, cases of students debts causing the shutdown of schools will be reduced and the knowledge of parents being aware of how much they owe owe will be increased.
